# 📘 Chapter 3: Analysis and Design with Root Locus Perspective  

This chapter focuses on the **Root Locus Method**, a graphical approach for analyzing and designing linear control systems. You will learn how to determine system stability and improve performance using root locus techniques.  

## 📑 Chapter Contents  
1️⃣ **Introduction** – Overview of the Root Locus method in control system analysis.  
2️⃣ **Drawing the Locus of Roots** – Step-by-step process of plotting the root locus.  
3️⃣ **Practical Examples** – Applying root locus techniques to real-world control systems.  
4️⃣ **Properties of the Locus of Roots** – Key characteristics and insights gained from root locus plots.  
5️⃣ **Designing a Control System by Locus** – Using root locus for controller and compensator design.  

## 🎯 Learning Objectives  
By the end of this chapter, you will:  
✅ Understand the significance of the Root Locus method.  
✅ Learn to construct and interpret root locus plots.  
✅ Analyze system stability and performance using root locus techniques.
