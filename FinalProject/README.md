# 📘 Final Project: Linear Control Systems Course  

This final project is designed to test and apply the concepts learned throughout the **Linear Control Systems** course. It provides an opportunity to further practice programming and implement control systems using the **MATLAB** environment.  

## 🎯 Project Objectives  
- **Test Knowledge** – Apply linear control system concepts to real-world problems.  
- **MATLAB Programming** – Use MATLAB to implement control system algorithms and simulations.  
- **System Analysis** – Analyze and design control systems using tools like Bode, Nyquist, Root Locus, and more.  
- **Practical Application** – Implement controllers, stability analysis, and system performance evaluation.  

## 📂 Project Contents  
- 📄 **Project Report** – Detailed documentation of the approach, analysis, and results.  
- 🧑‍💻 **MATLAB Code** – Scripts and functions for simulating and analyzing control systems.  
- 📊 **Simulations** – Visual results of system analysis and controller designs.  

## 🚀 Getting Started
